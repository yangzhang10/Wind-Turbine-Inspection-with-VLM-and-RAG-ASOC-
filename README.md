# Wind Turbine Inspection with VLM and RAG (ASOC 2025)

This repository contains the code and resources for our paper in Applied Soft Computing (ASOC).
It implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced Vision-Language Model (VLM) framework for zero-shot wind turbine blade inspection.

## Requirements & Environment

Tested on Google Colab with T4 GPU
Key packages: torch, transformers, faiss, numpy, matplotlib

## Repository Structure

1. code/ Main implementation (training & inference)
2. test/ Testing images used in the paper
3. Reference/ Knowledge images for retrieval
4. README.md This file

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab and select T4 GPU as the runtime.

2. Upload the reference images to a cloud storage service (e.g., Aliyun, it is used in this paper.) and obtain the URL for each image. Save these URLs in a CSV file, and place the file in the designated path specified in the code.

3. Upload the test images to the cloud storage and obtain the URL for each image. Save these URLs in another CSV file, and place the file in the designated path specified in the code.

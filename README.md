# Wind Turbine Inspection with VLM and RAG (ASOC 2025)

This repository contains the code and resources for our paper accepted in Applied Soft Computing (ASOC).
It implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced Vision-Language Model (VLM) framework for zero-shot wind turbine blade inspection.

## Requirements & Environment

Tested on Google Colab with T4 GPU
Key packages: torch, transformers, faiss, numpy, matplotlib

## Repository Structure

code/ Main implementation (training & inference)
test/ Testing images used in the paper
Reference/ Knowledge images for retrieval
README.md This file

## Usage

Open the notebook in Google Colab and select T4 GPU as the runtime.
